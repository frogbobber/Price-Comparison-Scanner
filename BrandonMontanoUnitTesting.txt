Brandon Montano Unit Testing Procedure-
While programming GUI.
I performed unit testing to make sure the correct text views and correct action listeners were indeed listening to the correct things in the GUI.
All unit tests are currently successful.
No future Unit tests are needed for the GUI.
The GUI is working under full functionality and we can continue to move on our future plans for the app.
