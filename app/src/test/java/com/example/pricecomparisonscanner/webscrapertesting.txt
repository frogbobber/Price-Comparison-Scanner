Testing:
	For each website, I would search for three products and run them through each extractor. In webscraper.java thereâ€™s a method for each website and those methods take in the URL for the website they need to connect to. To test I would transfer webscraper.java and extractor classes to an outside project and manually input a URL for a specific search on that website. The connection will retrieve the HTML for the site and that HTML is sent to its corresponding extractor for parsing. If the parser returns the correct URL, name, and price for each product in the search, it passes the test. I would double-check this by manually looking at a random product in the list and checking if the corresponding product on the website matches.
